# zoomdoctor

The `zoomdoctor` program is a diagnosis tool to prevent misconfiguration of my headset, microphone, and webcam for video calls.  
The tool is meant to be run manually prior to joining a video call from my Linux system. It’s completely unsupported and mainly for my personal use.

## Overview

This tool audits my personal audio and webcam configuration to make sure everything is working properly.

The zoomdoctor tool is a work in progress. I recommend that you don’t use it unless you know what you’re doing.

The tool is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

## Prerequisites

This tool requires Linux.

## Installation

Copy the `zoomdoctor` script to a directory in your `PATH`.

## Usage

Run `zoomdoctor`.
